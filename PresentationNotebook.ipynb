SQL is a standard programming language designed for managing data stored in databases, and it plays a crucial role in retrieving, inserting, updating, and deleting data. \r\n",

       "Throughout this assignment, you will have the opportunity to strengthen your SQL skills and apply your knowledge to real-world scenarios by working with the IMDb database. You will be presented with a series of tasks and challenges that will test your understanding of SQL concepts, especially database querying and extracting the database design. By completing this assignment, you will gain hands-on experience in writing SQL queries, understanding complex database relationships, and leveraging SQL to extract valuable insights from data. \r\n",

A notebook is an interactive computational environment in which users can execute a particular piece of code, observe the output, and make changes to the code to drive it to the desired output or explore more. This would be helpful during the debugging process for the SQL queries compared to using sqlite3 independently. [1]\r\n",

One great corollary of this scheme is that we can be absolutely sure that there will not be cascading rollbacks; that is, if a transaction aborts, no other transaction will have to roll back because of it!

If a cycle is detected in this graph, that means that we have deadlocked, and will not be able to proceed without terminating one of the involved transactions. A reasonable policy here would be to terminate the last transaction that joined the graph. Remember to remove edges between transactions once transactions get terminated or are otherwise no longer waiting for a resource â otherwise, you may detect deadlocks that don't exist!\r\n",

       "\n",
       "2. **Implementation Approach**:\n",
       "   - When implementing `PopSelf()`, you should focus on updating the `prev` and `next` links of the given link to effectively remove it from the list.\n",
       "   - You do not need to search through the list to find the link since the link is already provided.\n",

       "   - If you encounter errors like \"invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference,\" it suggests that there might be an issue with how you are handling pointers or nil values in your implementation.\n",

       "   - Based on the feedback provided, ensure that your implementation of `PopSelf()` focuses on linking the previous and next links of the given link correctly to remove it from the list.\n",
       "   - Avoid calling functions on nil pointers, as this can lead to runtime errors.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Testing and Debugging**:\n",
       "   - Test your implementation thoroughly to ensure it works as expected in different scenarios.\n",
       "   - If you encounter errors, debug by checking how you are handling pointers, linking operations, and nil values in your code.\n",
       "\n",
       "By following these guidelines and understanding the purpose of the `PopSelf()` function, you can approach writing the function for the Go assignment effectively. Remember to focus on handling the linking operations correctly to remove the given link from the list without the need for additional searching."
